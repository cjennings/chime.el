;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for chime--extract-time function with source-aware extraction:
;; - org-gcal events: extract ONLY from :org-gcal: drawer
;; - Regular events: prefer SCHEDULED/DEADLINE, fall back to plain timestamps
;; - Prevents duplicate entries when events are rescheduled

;;; Code:

;; Initialize package system for batch mode
(when noninteractive
  (package-initialize))

(require 'ert)

;; Load dependencies required by chime
(require 'dash)
(require 'alert)
(require 'async)
(require 'org-agenda)

;; Load chime from parent directory
(load (expand-file-name "../chime.el") nil t)

;; Load test utilities
(require 'testutil-general (expand-file-name "testutil-general.el"))
(require 'testutil-time (expand-file-name "testutil-time.el"))
