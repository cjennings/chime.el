# Pilot Test Refactoring - SUCCESS! âœ“

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Test:** `test-overdue-has-passed-time-today-all-day`
**Status:** COMPLETE AND WORKING

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Documented One Test
Added comprehensive documentation to test docstring capturing:
- TIME RELATIONSHIPS: Current time and event relationships
- DAY-OF-WEEK REQUIREMENTS: None needed
- SPECIAL PROPERTIES: All-day event, no repeating
- EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: Function should return t
- CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION: The hardcoded 2025-10-28 dates
- REFACTORING NOTES: Simple case, just needs TODAY

### 2. Created Time Helper Library
**File:** `tests/testutil-time.el`

**Core Functions:**
```elisp
(test-time-now)                          ; Base time (actual + 30 days)
(test-time-at days hours minutes)         ; Relative time
(test-time-today-at hour minute)          ; Today at specific time
(test-time-yesterday-at hour minute)      ; Yesterday
(test-time-tomorrow-at hour minute)       ; Tomorrow
(test-time-days-ago days &optional h m)   ; N days ago
(test-time-days-from-now days &optional h m) ; N days from now
```

**Timestamp Generation:**
```elisp
(test-timestamp-string time &optional all-day-p)  ; <2025-11-27 Thu 10:00>
(test-timestamp-range-string start end)            ; Range timestamps
(test-timestamp-repeating time repeater all-day-p) ; +1w, .+1d, etc.
```

**Mock Helper:**
```elisp
(with-test-time base-time
  ...)  ; Execute with mocked current-time
```

### 3. Refactored Test
**Before:**
```elisp
(let ((event (test-overdue--create-event
              "Today Event"
              "<2025-10-28 Tue>"
              nil)))
  (cl-letf (((symbol-function 'current-time)
             (lambda () (encode-time 0 0 10 28 10 2025))))
    (should (chime-event-has-any-passed-time event))))
```

**After:**
```elisp
(let* ((now (test-time-now))
       (today-timestamp (test-timestamp-string now t))
       (event (test-overdue--create-event
               "Today Event"
               today-timestamp
               nil)))
  (with-test-time now
    (should (chime-event-has-any-passed-time event))))
```

**Benefits:**
- No hardcoded dates
- Self-documenting (clearly shows "now" and "today")
- Will work forever (always generates valid future dates)

### 4. Found and Fixed Production Bug!
**Location:** `chime.el` lines 644-646 and 672-674

**Bug:** Calls to `(decode-time)` without arguments don't respect mocked `current-time`

**Fix:** Changed to `(decode-time (current-time))` which properly respects mocks

**Impact:** This bug only manifested in tests, but fixing it ensures the production code correctly uses `current-time` everywhere

### 5. Validated Everything Works
- Refactored test passes âœ“
- Full suite (339 tests) still passes âœ“
- Dynamic timestamps generate correctly âœ“

## Key Learnings

### 1. Production Code Bug with Mocking
`(decode-time)` without args uses the ACTUAL current time, not mocked time. Always pass `(current-time)` to it:
```elisp
;; Bad (doesn't respect mocks)
(decode-time)

;; Good (respects mocked current-time)
(decode-time (current-time))
```

### 2. Org Timestamp Format is Picky
Day names must match dates or `org-parse-time-string` fails:
- `<2025-11-27 Thu>` âœ“ (Nov 27, 2025 is actually Thursday)
- `<2025-11-27 Fri>` âœ— (would fail parsing)

Our helper calculates day-of-week automatically from the date.

### 3. Time Addition is Tricky
30 days from now isn't just `(+ seconds (* 30 86400))` - need to use `time-add` and `days-to-time` / `seconds-to-time`.

### 4. Documentation Template Works!
The structured documentation format helps us think through:
- What are the time relationships (not absolute dates)?
- Why was this specific date chosen?
- What's the expected behavior?

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Today if time permits)
1. Document remaining 12 tests in `test-chime-overdue-todos.el`
   - Just add docstrings, don't refactor yet
   - Capture time relationships for each

### Short Term (This Week)
2. Refactor remaining overdue tests using the working pattern
3. Document tests in 2-3 more simple files
4. Identify any edge cases or helper functions we need

### Medium Term (Next Week)
5. Refactor 2-3 more test files incrementally
6. Build up library of examples
7. Document learnings as we go

### Long Term
8. Complete all 15 files (228 tests)
9. Remove all hardcoded 2025 dates
10. Celebrate! ðŸŽ‰

## Template for Future Tests

```elisp
(ert-deftest test-name ()
  "Brief description.

TIME RELATIONSHIPS:
  Current time: <relative description>
  Event 1: <relative description>
  ...

DAY-OF-WEEK REQUIREMENTS:
  <Yes/No and why?>

SPECIAL PROPERTIES:
  - All-day: Yes/No
  - Timed: Yes/No
  - Repeating: Yes/No
  - Range: Yes/No

EXPECTED BEHAVIOR:
  <What should happen?>

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION (as of 2025-10-28):
  <What hardcoded dates are used?>

REFACTORING NOTES:
  <Any special considerations?>

REFACTORED: Uses dynamic timestamps via testutil-time.el"
  (test-setup)
  (unwind-protect
      (let* ((now (test-time-now))
             (event-time (test-time-today-at 14 0))
             (event-timestamp (test-timestamp-string event-time)))
        (with-test-time now
          (should (some-assertion))))
    (test-teardown)))
```

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `tests/testutil-time.el` - Time helper library
- `tests/TIMESTAMP_REFACTORING_PLAN.md` - Master plan
- `tests/PILOT_SUCCESS.md` - This file

### Modified Files
- `chime.el` - Fixed decode-time bug (2 locations)
- `test-chime-overdue-todos.el` - Documented and refactored 1 test

### Test Status
- Total tests: 339
- All passing: âœ“
- Refactored with dynamic timestamps: 1
- Documented but not refactored: 0
- Remaining to document: 228

## Success Metrics

- [x] Pilot test passes with dynamic timestamps
- [x] Full test suite still passes (339/339)
- [x] Helper library created and working
- [x] Documentation template validated
- [x] Production bug found and fixed
- [x] Approach is proven viable

**Conclusion:** The pilot was a complete success. We have a working pattern, validated tools, and a clear path forward. Ready to scale to all 228 tests!
