;;; Commentary:

;; Integration tests for chime--gather-info function.
;; Tests ensure that event information is collected correctly
;; and that titles are properly sanitized to prevent Lisp read
;; syntax errors during async serialization.

;;; Code:

;; Initialize package system for batch mode
(when noninteractive
  (package-initialize))

(require 'ert)

;; Load dependencies required by chime
(require 'dash)
(require 'alert)
(require 'async)
(require 'org-agenda)

;; Load chime from parent directory
(load (expand-file-name "../chime.el") nil t)

;; Load test utilities
(require 'testutil-general (expand-file-name "testutil-general.el"))
(require 'testutil-time (expand-file-name "testutil-time.el"))

The fix returns marker-file and marker-pos instead of the marker object,

Tests characters that could theoretically cause Lisp read syntax errors:
- Double quotes: string delimiters
- Backslashes: escape characters
- Semicolons: comment start
- Backticks/commas: quasiquote syntax
- Hash symbols: reader macros

These should all be properly escaped by format %S.
