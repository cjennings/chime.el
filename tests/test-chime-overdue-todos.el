;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for overdue TODO functionality controlled by
;; `chime-show-any-overdue-with-day-wide-alerts'.
;;
;; When enabled (default t): Show overdue TODO items with day-wide alerts
;; When disabled (nil): Only show today's all-day events, not overdue items
;;
;; "Overdue" means events with timestamps in the past (before today).

;;; Code:

;; Initialize package system for batch mode
(when noninteractive
  (package-initialize))

(require 'ert)

;; Load dependencies required by chime
(require 'dash)
(require 'alert)
(require 'async)
(require 'org-agenda)

;; Load chime from parent directory
(load (expand-file-name "../chime.el") nil t)

;; Load test utilities
(require 'testutil-general (expand-file-name "testutil-general.el"))
(require 'testutil-time (expand-file-name "testutil-time.el"))
