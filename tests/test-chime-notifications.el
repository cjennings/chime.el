;;; Commentary:

;; Unit tests for chime--notifications function.
;; Tests cover normal cases, boundary cases, and error cases.

;;; Code:

;; Initialize package system for batch mode
(when noninteractive
  (package-initialize))

(require 'ert)

;; Load dependencies required by chime
(require 'dash)
(require 'alert)
(require 'async)
(require 'org-agenda)

;; Load chime from parent directory
(load (expand-file-name "../chime.el") nil t)

;; Load test utilities
(require 'testutil-general (expand-file-name "testutil-general.el"))
(require 'testutil-time (expand-file-name "testutil-time.el"))
