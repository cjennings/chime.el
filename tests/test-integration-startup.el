;;; Commentary:

;; Integration tests for chime startup and configuration validation.
;;
;; Tests the complete startup workflow:
;; - Valid org-agenda-files configuration
;; - chime-validate-configuration checks
;; - chime-check async event gathering
;; - Modeline population
;;
;; Components integrated:
;; - chime-validate-configuration (validates runtime requirements)
;; - chime-check (async event gathering via org-agenda-list)
;; - chime--update-modeline (updates modeline string)
;; - org-agenda-list (expands events from org files)
;;
;; Validates:
;; - Chime finds correct number of events from org-agenda-files
;; - Validation passes with proper configuration
;; - Modeline gets populated after check completes
;; - Mixed event types (scheduled, deadline, TODO states) work correctly

;;; Code:

;; Initialize package system for batch mode
(when noninteractive
  (package-initialize))

This is the core startup integration test. Validates that when:
- org-agenda-files is properly configured with real .org files
- Files contain scheduled/deadline events
- chime-check is called (normally triggered by startup timer)

Then:
- Events are successfully gathered from org-agenda-list
- Event count matches expected number
- Modeline string gets populated

Components integrated:
- org-agenda-files (user configuration)
- org-agenda-list (expands events from org files)
- chime-check (async wrapper around event gathering)
- chime--gather-info (extracts event details)
- chime--update-modeline (updates modeline display)"
