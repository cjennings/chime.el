;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains debug functions for troubleshooting chime.el behavior.
;; It is only loaded when `chime-debug' is non-nil.
;;
;; Enable with:
;;   (setq chime-debug t)
;;   (require 'chime)
;;
;; Available debug functions:
;; - `chime--debug-dump-events' - Show all stored upcoming events
;; - `chime--debug-dump-tooltip' - Show tooltip content
;; - `chime--debug-config' - Show complete configuration dump
;; - `chime-debug-monitor-event-loading' - Monitor when events are first loaded
;;
;; All functions write to *Messages* buffer without cluttering echo area.
;;
;; The event loading monitor is particularly useful for diagnosing timing
;; issues where the modeline takes a while to populate after Emacs startup.
;; It will send a libnotify notification and log detailed timing information
;; when events are first loaded.

;;; Code:

;; chime-debug.el is loaded by chime.el, so chime is already loaded
;; No need for (require 'chime) here
