## Bug: Recurring Events Show Duplicate Entries in Tooltip

**Environment:**
- Emacs version: 30.0.92
- Chime version: 0.6.0
- OS: Linux 6.17.4-arch2-1

**Description:**

Events with daily repeaters (e.g., `+1d`) appear multiple times in the tooltip, once for each day within the lookahead window.

**To Reproduce:**

1. Create an org file with a recurring event:
```org
** Daily Wrap Up
<2025-06-17 Tue 22:00 +1d>
```

2. Set a long tooltip lookahead:
```elisp
(setq chime-tooltip-lookahead-hours 8760)  ; 1 year
```

3. Enable chime-mode and hover over the modeline icon
4. Observe tooltip showing the same event multiple times

**Expected behavior:**

Each unique event title should appear only once in the tooltip, showing the next upcoming occurrence.

**Actual behavior:**

```
Daily Wrap Up at 10:00 PM (in 6h 5m)
Daily Wrap Up at 10:00 PM (in 6h 5m)
Daily Wrap Up at 10:00 PM (in 6h 5m)
[... 18 visible duplicates, 376 more events]
```

**Root Cause Analysis:**

`org-agenda-list` expands recurring events into multiple instances. Each gets a separate `org-marker`, and `chime--update-modeline` treats each marker as a unique event. Current deduplication only handles multiple timestamps per event object, not multiple event objects with the same title.

**Proposed Solution:**

Add title-based deduplication in `chime--update-modeline` after per-event processing (see BUGS.md for detailed implementation).

**Workaround:**

Reduce `chime-tooltip-lookahead-hours`:
```elisp
(setq chime-tooltip-lookahead-hours 168)  ; 1 week instead of 1 year
```
